# meetups-lehi

[UtahJS](https://www.meetup.com/UtahJS/) Lehi - Meetup topics, suggestions, and speaker signups!


We invite all of you to propose ideas for presentations you would like to see or things you would like to share with the group. While you're in here, vote for the presentations you would like to see or volunteer to present on an unclaimed topic.

- To Suggest a topic, create a new issue with the `Request` label. Don't forget to describe any details you're interested in hearing about!
- To Volunteer to speak, find a issue with a topic you're interested in and add a comment or add a new issue as above noting your availability to speak. In either case, add the label `Volunteer`!
- To Vote for a request or presentation just click the :+1: reaction button on the issue description. Please don't downvote, that's just rude. If you feel a suggestion is off topic or not interesting, simply ignore it or ask for more information in a comment.
